1.1.0:
Rainer Loritz <rloritz@gwdg.de> - Wed Apr  5 21:17:58 PDT 2000
- fixed bug in GUI_Image: First constructor called second one, both called
inherited constructors -> messed up. No more.

- added GUI_Button feature: One may specify a second image for a real click and
release look and feel which is also reacting when moving the pointer off the
button.

- added another GUI_Button feature: With Disable() and Enable() one can
tell a button to be clickable or not. It is then appropiately displayed.

- modified GUI event behaviour: Before, GUI ran with full CPU workload even
without given an idle procedure. Now it uses the idle-friendly WaitEvent if
such a flag is given to the Run procedure. The calls to widget-idle
procedures are sacrificed in this case :-(.

- added GUI_Area feature: With another constructor one may specify a
frame color and thickness for the edge of the area.

- added GUI_Area feature: With an optional parameter a shape of the area can
be determined. So far either a rectangular or an elliptic (adjusted to area)
shape is possible.

- added GUI_TermWin feature: With "SetColoring" one can specify a foreground
and a background color where the background can be left transparent.

- new GUI_Font object: Given either a BMP name or surface (or nothing), it
represents a font with possibilities to plot colored text in opaque or
transparent mode.

- added GUI_button features: An additional constructor provides a way to
specify a text from which a 3D or 2D  button is generated (in gray colours).
A new option allows to determine the text alignment.

- added GUI_widget function: Redraw() redisplays ONLY the widget because
complete GUI_REDRAW consumes much time.
*** HERE I FOUND AN DOCUM. ERROR: the comments say the surface will be locked
*** before a call to Display(). This is not true and it should be in no case,
*** because otherwise inside Display() there wouldn't be allowed any SDL
*** graphics functions as FillRect etc.

- new GUI_Menu object: Pulldown menus in SDL! Very straightforward menu design,
but may be a complicated way of internal coding. The GUI_Menu is using the
GUI_Submenu and GUI_Menuitem classes to control the menu behaviour. It's all
quite up and down design, but it works. The programmer has contact only with
GUI_Menu and MUST NOT add the GUI_Submenu/items to the GUI himself.
Everything is managed by GUI_Menu.

- new button feature: check marks. Originally thought for menus, but should
work generally.

TO DO:	- menu memory management is bad
	- graphical functions for ellipse and boundary fill
	- (improved keyboard functions as input focus, tab order etc.)
