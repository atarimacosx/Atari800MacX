The Controllers Tab allows the selection of Joystick types for the up
to 4 joysticks that may be used with the Atari. &nbsp;The Atari
400/800/5200 models support the use of 4 joysticks, while the XL/XE
models allowed 2.&nbsp; (4 are allowed on the XL/XE with the Multijoy4
modification).<br>

<br>

<u><b>Joysticks<br>

<br>

</b></u>For each joystick port, you can choose between
6 types of joystick emulation:<br>

<ul>

  <li>None - There is no joystick on this port.</li>

  <li>Numeric Keypad - Use the numeric keypad keys as a joystick.
&nbsp;The key layout for this joystick is programmable by pressing the
"Left Keyboard"
button.</li>

  <li>Left Keyboard - Use keys on the left side of the keyboard as a
joystick. &nbsp;The key layout for this joystick is programmable by
pressing the "Numeric
Keypad" button.</li>

  <li>HID Controller 1 - Use the first attached Macintosh OS X HID
Joystick or Gamepad as a joystick.<br>

  </li>

  <li>HID Controller 2 - Use the second attached Macintosh OS X HID
Joystick or Gamepad as a joystick.</li>

  <li>Mouse Emulation - Use the Mouse as an emulated Atari device on
this port. &nbsp;Only one port may use Mouse emulation at this time.</li>

</ul>

Other than Mouse Emulation, the same device can be set on more than one
port. &nbsp;This way, if you only have one gamepad, it can be passed
around to the four players, if you are playing a game that doesn't
require simultaneous use.<br>

<br>

When using the HID Controllers, analog joysticks on the controllers
will provide port analog input as well, allowing the joystick to be
used as a
paddle for such games as Super Breakout. &nbsp;In this case, the x-axis
will
be paddle 1, and the y-axis paddle 2, if the Use X-Axis for both
paddles
is not checked. &nbsp;If it is, the x-axis will be both paddle 1 and
paddle 2.<br><br>Also
for HID controllers, if the gamepad has multiple Analog joysticks, you
may chose to use each of them for a different Atari joystick.
&nbsp;This is done by selecting the Multi Stick option for that gamepad
on the<a href="GamepadsTab.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Gamepads Tab </span></a>and then selection multiple joysticks here to use the same HID controller.<br>

<br>

For each joystick port, you can also set autofire mode. &nbsp;When
autofire is on, it can be on only when the joystick button is pressed,
or can be on continuously.<br>

<br>

<u><b>Enable Multijoy4 Joysticks for XL/XE Machines<br>

<br>

</b></u>This checkbox enables the emulation of the Multijoy hardware
which
allowed up to 4 joysticks to be used with custom designed games on the
XL/XE series of machines.&nbsp; Normally, XL/XE machines only have 2
joystick ports.<br>

<br>

<u><b>Mouse Emulation</b></u><br>

<br>

Finally, if one of the joystick ports is set to Mouse Emulation, the
Emulated Device pulldown will become active in the Mouse Emulation
section. &nbsp;Then, you can choose one of the following Atari devices
to emulate with the Mouse:
<ul>

  <li>None &#8211; no device emulated,</li>

  <li>Paddles &#8211; analog controllers. The paddles are simple
potentiometers, attached two to one Atari port. Each paddle has single
button. Horizontal mouse position and left button is mapped to the
first paddle, vertical position and right button to the second paddle.
The paddles are used mostly in games (e.g. Arkanoid, SuperBreakout,
Kaboom). &nbsp;The checkbox at the bottom of the page lets you specify
that Horizontal mouse position is used for both the first and second
paddles.</li>

  <li>Atari touch tablet &#8211; a controller, which returns position of
where it has been touched. It has two buttons, which are mapped to your
mouse buttons. The touch tablet is used mostly in graphics editors,</li>

  <li>Koala Pad &#8211; a device very similar to the touch tablet. The only
difference is that it has reverse up/down orientation,</li>

  <li>Light pen &#8211; it&#8217;s a pen, with which you can draw directly on the
TV screen (its button presses when you touch the screen). The mouse
controls the position of light pen. The left mouse button is the light
pen&#8217;s button. The right mouse button can be used to display mouse
cursor, which is useful if an Atari program doesn't display it,</li>

  <li>Light gun &#8211; works similarly to the light pen. The difference is
that button (trigger) signal is inverted,</li>

  <li>Amiga mouse &#8211; the standard mouse used with Commodore Amiga
computers. This device can be attached to an 8-bit Atari and is used by
some software. As in the real Atari, only the left mouse button can be
used,</li>

  <li>Atari ST mouse &#8211; the standard mouse used with 16-bit Atari ST
computers. The device is very similar to the Amiga mouse, and only left
button can be used as well,</li>

  <li>Atari trak-ball &#8211; a track-ball device. Similar in operation to
Atari ST mouse,</li>

  <li>Joystick &#8211; the mouse emulating a joystick. This device can be
used with all software using normal Atari joystick.</li>

</ul>

There are extra parameters available to adjust the function of some of
the emulated devices. &nbsp;They are:<br>

<br>

<u><b>Speed of Emulated Device</b></u><br>

<blockquote>If the controller moves too slow or too fast, use the Speed
of emulated device option. &nbsp;Also, in Full Screen mode, libSDL on
the Macintosh does not allow the Mouse to be grabbed. &nbsp;This may
cause the emulated device to not be able to reach the full limits of
the Atari Screen. &nbsp;To fix this, increase this value. &nbsp;On my
system, using Kensington Mouse Works with a fair amount of
acceleration, a value of 15 in this field works nicely for full screen.<br>

</blockquote>

<u><b>Minimum and Maximum Values</b></u><br>

<blockquote>For Paddles, the Atari touch tablet and the Koala Pad you
can specify the range of controller values.<br>

</blockquote>

<u><b>Horizontal and Vertical Offset</b></u><br>

<blockquote>You can calibrate the Light pen and the Light gun using
Horz/Vert offsets. You should change these values if the program you're
using indicates the pen/gun is in different location than the mouse
pointer (right-click to toggle displaying of mouse pointer).<br>

</blockquote>

<u><b>Intertia of Emulated Joystick</b></u><br>

<blockquote>The Inertia of emulated joystick option is available only
for the emulated Joystick. It indicates how far the pointer can move on
a single mouse movement. This is because the joystick is a digital
device (moved in a certain direction or not), while the mouse is analog
and can move in a
direction faster or slower. &nbsp;This will set how far you have to
move the
device to get a digital indication of movement in that direction.<br>

</blockquote>

<u><b>Use X-Axis of Joystick/Mouse Emulation for Both Paddles in a
Paddle Set</b></u><br>

<blockquote>Checking this box allows X-Axis motion on an analog
joystick or
the mouse emulation to be used for both Paddle 1 and Paddle 2.
&nbsp;This overcomes the unusual motion required for the second player
to move the joystick or mouse vertically to control a horizontal paddle
in games such as Super Breakout. &nbsp;In the unchecked mode,
Horizontal (x-axis) motion is tied to paddle 1, and Vertical (y-axis)
motion is tied to paddle 2.<br>

</blockquote>

<b><u>CX85 Keypad</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This &nbsp;area includes a selection to enable or disable the emulation
of the CX85 keypad. &nbsp;The CX85 may also be enabled/disabled from the <a href="ControlMenu.html">Control Menu</a>. &nbsp;The joystick port the CX85 is plugged into may also be selected here. &nbsp;When enabled, the keys are as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; Mac Keys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CX85 Keys<br>&nbsp;
