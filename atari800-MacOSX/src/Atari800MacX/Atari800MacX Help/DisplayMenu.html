The Display menu on the Atari800MacX emulator allows you to control the
format of the display, grab the mouse input for mouse emulation, and
take screenshots of the Atari screen. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
There are significant changes in version 5.3 on this menu.

<br>
<br>
The Scale Factor choices are now gone, as you can simply resize the
emulator window by dragging it, and you are no longer limited to 1x, 2x,
3x, and 4x scaling, but have continuous scaling.<br>
<br>
The Fullscreen mode is also different, in that it is a standard MacOS
fullscreen, with Mac menus available, and the screen in a seperate
workspace.
<br>
<br>

The menu has the following menu
selections:<br>



<br>


<b><u>Display Width Submenu</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This submenu lets you set the width of the emulated Atari
screen in the window. You may choose between narrow, default, and full
widths of the Atari screen. &nbsp;These correspond to 320x240, 336x240,
and 384x240 respectively. This may also be set on the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display
Tab</a> page of the Preferences Window.</blockquote>



<b><u> Scaling Mode Submenu<br>



</u></b>
<blockquote>This Submenu lets chose the type of&nbsp; scaling to be
applied to the screen.&nbsp; Normal mode displays the screen without
any or scanlines.&nbsp; Scanline mode inserts scanlines as
they might have appeared on old classic monitors or TV displays.&nbsp;
This may also be set on the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display
Tab</a> page of the Preferences Window.
</blockquote>





<b><u>Artifacting Mode Submenu</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This submenu lets you set&nbsp;choose how the emulator
simulates Artifacting, which occurred when the original Atari used a TV
for displaying its video. &nbsp;Some games depended on the colors these
Artifacting effects produced. This may also be set on the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display
Tab</a> page of the Preferences Window.</blockquote>



<b><u>Toggle Fullscreen mode (cmd-F)</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to toggle the display between
Fullscreen and Windowed modes. &nbsp;More info on screen modes can be
found on the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display
Tab</a> page of the
Preferences Window. <br>



</blockquote>



<b><u>80 Column Card Selection Submenu</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This submenu lets you set&nbsp;choose if an 80
    Column Display is connected to the Atari.  There are
    three types available.  The XEP80 may be connected to
    either Joystick Port 1 or Joystick Port 2.  It does not require ROMS for operation. <br>The Austin Franklin 80 Column board does require two ROMs to operate, and
    the paths to those ROMs must be entered on the Preferences
    ROM page before this menu item will be enabled.
    <br>The Bit3 Full View card also requires 3 ROMs for operation, which must be specified on the Preferences ROMs tab as well.
    
Column Display adapter is connected, and if it is, to which joytick
port, 1 or 2.<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>80 Column Display Autoswitch</u><br>


</b>
<blockquote>
This menu item determines 80 column display is automatically displayed when it's in use.  The system will also switch back
to the normal Atari display upon cold reset.
<br>For the Austin Franklin board, the 80 column display is always shown.
<br>For the XEP80, the 80 column display is switched to when data is detected being sent to the XEP80, normally when the driver is loaded.
<br>For the Bit3 Full View, the display is switched under control
of the videomode switch which present on the board.
</blockquote>

<b><u>Display 80 Column Screen (cmd-shift-X)</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to manually toggle between the normal
Atari display and the 80 column card display. It is only enabled
when one of the 80 column cards are connected.<br>



</blockquote>



<b><u>Toggle FPS Display on/off (cmd-K)</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you toggle on or off the display of
the emulators frames per second in the Window Title.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<b><u>Toggle Vertical Sync Enabled on/off</u><br>

</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you toggle on or off using VSYNC with the display.  Vertical sync (VSync) in SDL is a method used to synchronize the frame rate of the emulator with the refresh rate of the monitor, helping to prevent screen tearing. By enabling VSync, the emulator will wait for the monitor to finish displaying the current frame before presenting the next one, ensuring smoother visuals.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<b><u>Linear Smoothing Filter Enabled on/off</u></b><br>
<b> </b>
<blockquote>TThis menu item allows you toggle on or off using linear smoothing with the display.  Linear Smoothing in SDL smooths the display, making it look less sharp, and perhaps giving it a retro feel.  Use of smoothing is a personal preference.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<b><u>Realistic Pixel Aspect Ratio Enabled on/off</u></b><br>
<b> </b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you toggle on or off realistic pixel aspect ratios.  If it is disabled, the emulator will draw the screen using square pixels (pixel height == pixel width), which is how it has operated since version 1.0.  However, on the original Atari display screens, pixels were not square.  With modern displays and GPU scaling, we are now able to simulate non square pixel ratios.  If it is enabled, for NTSC it uses a width:height ratio of 6:7 and for PAL is uses a ration of 26:25.&nbsp;</blockquote>


<b><u>Grab Mouse mode on/off (F16)</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This menu item toggles the emulators to control of the
mouse for
using it as an emulated Atari controller. &nbsp;More information on
Mouse emulation can be found on the <a href="ControllersTab.html">Controllers
Tab</a> of the Preferences Window.<br>



</blockquote>



<b><u>Screenshot (F12 or F13)</u><br>



</b>
<blockquote>This menu items allows &nbsp;you to take a screenshot of
the Atari
screen. &nbsp;It will be stored as a .PCX format file in the same
directory as the emulator executable. &nbsp;Future versions of the
emulator may use a more Macintosh graphics format, but for now this is
the format the graphics core uses. The great Shareware program Graphic
Converter may be used to read this format.<br>
