The Display Tab is the heart of the graphics control of the
emulator.&nbsp; <br>
<img src="DisplayTab.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 752px; height: 515px;">
There are significant changes in version 5.3 on this tab.
<br>
<br>
No longer
do you select Fullscreen or Windowed from here.  The Fullscreen mode
uses the standard
Apple mechanism of the green window button to go to Fullscreen mode from
standard (in addition to the tradition Atari800MacX Cmd-Return or Cmd-F).
The fullscreen mode is also different, in that it is a standard MacOS
fullscreen, with Mac menus available, and the screen in a seperate
workspace.  This elilinates the need for the Fullscreen monitor options,
as the standard debug monitor now works in fullscreen also.   By default, fullscreen mode will
normally fill the entire screen, and not keep the
normal Atari aspect ratio.  If you would prefer to keep the aspect ratio, then check the "Keep Aspect Ratio in Fullscreen" option.
<br>
<br>
The Scale Factor choices are now gone, as you can simply resize the
emulator window by dragging it, and you are no longer limited to 1x, 2x,
3x, and 4x scaling, but have continuous scaling.  If you would prefer, you can still keep the integer scaling by checking the "Always Use Integral Window Scaling Factor" option.<br>
<br>
The choice of Renderer is also gone, as now MacOS Metal is always used.
<br>
<br>
There is a choice of normal scaling, or using Scanlines, the Smooth option
that was in pre 5.x versions is now gone.
<br>
<br>
Remaining on this tab, things you can change:<br>
<br>
<b><u>Display Width</u></b><br>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose between narrow,
default, and full widths of the Atari screen. &nbsp;These correspond to
320x240, 336x240, and 384x240 respectively when display size is 1x the normal Atari scrren.&nbsp; You can also change
this setting from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display Menu.</a><br>
</blockquote>


<b><u>TV Mode</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose to the refresh rate
of the emulator, either NTSC (60 frames per second) or PAL (50 frames
per
second).<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<b><u>Refresh Ratio</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This pull down allows you to choose how often to redraw the
simulated Atari screen. &nbsp;You can choose to do it every Atari frame,
or every
2nd, 3rd, or 4th one. &nbsp;On very slow Macs, this could be used to
bring
the frame rate up to full speed (50 or 60 frames per second).&nbsp; The
checkbox then lets you determine if player/missile collisions are
detected in the frames that are skipped.&nbsp; By default, they are.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<b><u>Artifacting Mode</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This pull down allows you to choose how the emulator
simulates Artifacting, which occurred when the original Atari used a TV
for displaying its video. &nbsp;Some games depended on the colors these
Artifacting effects produced.<br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<b><u>Use New Artifacting</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox allows you to choose if the new Artifacting
method released in Atari800MacX 3.3 should be used.
&nbsp;It&nbsp;produces much clearer text, and correctly varies
luminance and displays player missile graphics in artifacted mode.<br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<b><u>Color Palette</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>These options allow the user to customize the colors used
by the
Macintosh to Emulate the Atari's color palette. 8-bit Atari machines
have
256 colors, and the emulator can either generate a palette, or use a
pre-generated
palette stored in a file. &nbsp;By default, it uses the real.act file
stored
in the Palettes folder in the application directory. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
If the "Use Palette from File" checkbox is checked, then you can choose
the palette file with the Choose.. button. &nbsp;If you wish, you may
then
also check the "Adjust File Palette" checkbox to adjust the Black
Level,
White Level, and Intensity parameters described below. &nbsp;These
adjustments do not affect the file itself.<br>
  <br>
If the "Use Palette from File" checkbox is not checked, then the
emulator will generate a palette using the values you enter for the
following 4 parameters:<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Black level</b> adjusts brightness of Atari colors 0, 16,
32, etc. (darkest ones),</li>
    <li><b>White level</b> adjusts brightness of Atari colors 15, 31,
47, etc. (lightest ones),</li>
    <li><b>Intensity</b> adjusts saturation of all colors,</li>
    <li><b>Color shift</b> adjusts hues to be used for Atari colors
16-255 (0-15 are always gray). A hue is used for colors 16-31, next one
for colors 32-47, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Each parameter must be an integer within range 0-255.<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>Vertical Sync Enabled</u></b><br>
<b> </b>
<blockquote>This checkboxd allows you to turn on or off using VSYNC with the display.  Vertical sync (VSync) in SDL is a method used to synchronize the frame rate of the emulator with the refresh rate of the monitor, helping to prevent screen tearing. By enabling VSync, the emulator will wait for the monitor to finish displaying the current frame before presenting the next one, ensuring smoother visuals.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<b><u>Show Frames Per Second In Window Title</u></b><br>
<b> </b>
<blockquote>This checkbox lets you choose to display the Frames Per
Second (FPS) that the emulator is running at the moment. &nbsp;This can
be used to check that your Macintosh is fast enough to run the Atari at
full speed. &nbsp;It should indicate 50fps for PAL, and 60fps for NTSC.
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also change this setting from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display
Menu.</a><br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<b><u>Leds/Indicators<br>
<br>
</u></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
The first four of these options allow the user to
chose if disk activity indicators are shown in the
Atari Emulator window (lower right corner) and in
the Media Status Window (Driver Status LED's and
sector numbers on drive doors).<br>
The next option determines if the 1200XL LED's
are shown in the Atari emulator window.<br>
The next option determines if the sector number
for the hard disk associated with the SIDE2 CF
Disk is shown in the Atari emulator window.<br>
The final option determines if a Atari Caps Lock
indicator for lower case and graphics is
displayed in the Atari emulator window.  Note,
this indicator is determined by reading the Atari
low memory location which the OS which controls it.
