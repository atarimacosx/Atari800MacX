The Atari System Tab controls the type of Atari System that the
emulator is emulating, as well as allows some aspects of the Atari OS
and emulation to be controlled.<br>




<br>




<img src="SystemTab.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 753px; height: 514px;"><br>




<br>




<b><u>Atari Type</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This pulldown allows the user to chose the type of Atari
machine emulated, and it's RAM size.</blockquote>




<b><u>Disable Basic</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Atari Basic cartridge is
disabled when the emulator boots or causes a Cold Reset. &nbsp;<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Disable Basic on Warmstart if Disable Basic Selected</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Atari Basic cartridge is
disabled when the user causes a Warm Reset.&nbsp; Note, the simple
Disable Basic checkbox must also be selected for this to work.&nbsp;
Also, note this is not how the Actual Atari HW functions, but is
provided as a user convienence. &nbsp;<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Boot From Cassette</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the emulated Atari will boot
from the emulated cassette when it is rebooted. &nbsp;After the boot,
you must press the space key to start the cassette (like pressing Play
on the actual recorder).<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Limit To Normal Atari Speed</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the speed (in frames per
second)
of the emulator is limited to 50 or 60 (PAL or NTSC), of if it can free
run, allowing it to run as fast as your Macintosh able. &nbsp;This
feature can also be controlled from the <a href="ControlMenu.html">Control
Menu.</a>
&nbsp;<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Ignore Header Write Protect Bit On ATR Disk Images<br>




<br>




</u>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This checkbox should be checked to
ignore the Header Write
Protect Bit that is set in some ATR disk images.&nbsp; It
is unchecked by default, and should only be checked if the user needs
to be able to write to an ATR image that has the bit set.&nbsp; When
this box is checked, the user will be able to set the drive to either
read-only or read/write in the <a href="DriveManagement.html">Drive
Management</a> panel. <br>




<br>




</div>




<b><u>Use International Keyboard Translation<br>




<br>




</u>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This checkbox should be checked to to
use keymapping specified for an International keyboard in the
International Input Menu in System Preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this is
you are using an non-US English keyboard and want key presses properly
translated to Atari keys.<br>




<br>




<br>




</div>




<b><u>Atari Computer Type Used For Auto Type Switching from 5200 mode<br>




<br>




</u>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">When the emulator is operating in 5200
mode, and the user inserts computer media (cartridge, disk, executable
file), the emulator will automatically switch to Computer mode.
&nbsp;It defaults to an 800XL with 64K, however, this pulldown allows
you to choose which computer type will be switched to automatically.<br>




<br>




<br>




</div>




<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arrow Keys</span></span><br><blockquote><b>



</b>
The Arrow keys assignment option selects the function of arrow keys:<br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 680px; height: 104px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Up</td><td>Down</td><td>Left</td><td>Right</td></tr><tr><td>Control+Arrows</td><td>Control+'-'</td><td>Control+'='</td><td>Control+'+'</td><td>Control+'*'</td></tr><tr><td>Arrow Keys Only</td><td>-</td><td>=</td><td>+</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>F1 - F4</td><td>F1</td><td>F2</td><td>F3</td><td>F4</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>The
are no separate arrow keys in Atari. Instead, keys -, =, + and * move
the cursor when pressed with the control key. However, in many programs
where typing these characters isnít necessary, the arrow keys are used
without the Control key.<br><br>F1-F4 keys are present only in some
Atari XL models. However, the OS in every XL/XE machine supports these
keys, so some people even mount these keys by themselves to get
following functions:<br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 690px; height: 132px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>F1</td><td>F2</td><td>F3</td><td>F4</td></tr><tr><td>Alone</td><td>cursor up</td><td>cursor down</td><td>cursor left</td><td>cursor right</td></tr><tr><td>With Shift</td><td>cursor to top-left corner</td><td>cursor to bottom-left conrner</td><td>cursor to left margin</td><td>cursor to right margin</td></tr><tr><td>With Control</td><td>lock/unlock keyboard&nbsp;</td><td>turn display off (any other key turns it back on)</td><td>toggle key click</td><td>toggle international character set</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote><b><u>Emulation Speed<br>




<br>




</u>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If the limit to normal Atari Speed is
checked above, then this control will determine the speed at which the
emulator runs relative to a real Atari. &nbsp;It can be adjusted from
10% to 300%, with the default being 100%, or the same speed as a real
Atari.<br>


</div>




<br>




<b><u>Enable SIO Patch</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>The SIO (Serial Input/Output) patch is meant for speeding
up
disk operations. Originally, data between Atari computer and a disk
drive
is sent using slow, serial transmission (19200 bits per second). The
Atari800
core emulator fully emulates the disk drive, so unlike other emulators
it
does not require the patch. However, it is much faster, if the emulator
can
immediately transfer data between a disk image and the Atari&#8217;s
memory,
skipping
serial transmission emulation. The patch is only a change in the Atari
OS,
it does not disable real drive emulation.<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Enable H: Patch</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Hard Disk Drive Device
patch
is applied to the OS. &nbsp;The H: ('Hard Disk') device gives access to
every file on your Macintosh to every Atari program. The device number
specifies the base directory to be used and if the text conversion is
applied:<br>




  
  
  
  
  <ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H0: &#8211; program directory, no conversion</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H1: - H4: &#8211; directories #1-#4, no
conversion</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H5: &#8211; program directory, text
conversion
applied</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H6: - H9: &#8211; directories #1-#4, text
conversion applied</li></ul></blockquote><b><u>Enable D: Patch</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the D: Hard Disk Drive Device
patch
is applied to the OS. &nbsp;This patch overrides drives D5: through D8:
and uses then to access some of the same Macintosh directories that the
H: device does. &nbsp;The device number
specifies the base directory to be used and if the text conversion is
applied:<br><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;D5: - D6: &#8211; directories #1-#2, no
conversion</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;D7: - D8: &#8211; directories #1-#4, text
conversion applied</li></ul>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Enable P: Patch</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Printer Patch (P:) is
applied to the emulator. When the patch is enabled, the user may then
select one of the printer emulations from the Printer Preferences Tab,
or from the Media Status Window.<br>




  <br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Enable R: Patch</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Serial Port Patch (R:) is
applied to the emulator. When using the R: patch, you may either choose
to have the Serial port instead use the network, or an actual physical
serial port.<br><br>When the patch is enabled and using the network, the user may then
specify
the TCP port number to use to "dial-in" to BBS software using telnet in
place of the original modem connection. &nbsp; To "dial-out" to a
remote telnet server, in your Atari terminal software, you should send
"ATDI ip-address port". &nbsp;For example, to call a server at adddress
www.example.org and port 1234, you would type "ATDI WWW.EXAMPLE.ORG
1234".<br><br>When the patch is enabled and using serial, the user may select the serial port to use from the drop down menu. &nbsp;<br>




</blockquote>








<b><u>XEP80 Connected</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the XEP80 80 column display
unit is attached. &nbsp;If it is, then the pulldown listed next will
determine which joystick port the XEP80 is connected to, Joystick port
1 or 2.<br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">XEP80 Foreground and Background Colors</span><br>




</b>
<blockquote>These fields determine the colors that will be used to
display the XEP monitor screen. &nbsp;The defaults are 15 for
foreground and 0 for background which will be black on white. &nbsp;The
numbers range between 0 and 255 and corespond to Atari color numbers.
&nbsp;You can experiment to find different colors. &nbsp;A couple of
other options for foreground are 63 (Amber) and 207 (Green). <br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<b><u>Enable Sound</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the playback of Atari Sound is
emulated. &nbsp;This feature can also be controlled from the <a href="SoundMenu.html">Sound
Menu.</a> &nbsp;<br>




  <br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Use Hi-Fi Sound</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>Starting with Version 4.3 of Atari800MacX, Hi-Fi sound is
always selected, and is no longer an option. &nbsp;However, there is
now an option to use 16bit or 8bit sound with the new "synchronized
sound", which eliminates the issues with SDL sound where noise, or
total lack of sound, was present in some games and demos (The WoofWoof
demo was a good example, Ultima is an example of a game with issues
with the old sound).<br>When the sound quality is changed (between 8
and 16 bits), the program must be quit and reentered before the change
will take effect..<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Enable Console Speaker Sound (Keyclicks)<br>




<br>




</u>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This checkbox determines if the console
speaker is emulated.&nbsp; This is produces the keyclicks when typing
on the Atari keyboard.<br>




</div>




<br>




<b><u>Enable SERIO Sound (Disk I/O)</u></b><br>




<blockquote>This checkbox determines if the Serial IO
sound is emulated.&nbsp; This is what produces the sound when Disk or
Cassette Input/Output occurs.<br>

</blockquote>

<b><u>Mute Audio When Atari800MacX is not Active</u></b><br>




<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This checkbox determines if the sound is played from the emulator when it is not the foreground application.</div>
