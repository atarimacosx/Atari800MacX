The Expansions Tab allows the user to specify the size of memory
expansions to be used with the Atari 800 computers, and to specify Hard
Disk expansions which may be used with the XL computers.&nbsp;<br>
It also allows you to set the media and options
for use with the Ulitmate1mb and SIDE2 expansions.

</b>
<blockquote>These pulldowns allow the user to chose the size of memory
expansions that are used with the 400/800 computers. &nbsp;You can
choose the size of both the Axlon and Mosaic expansions. &nbsp;To
actually use machines with these expansions, you can select the machine
in either the <a href="ControlMenu.html">Control Menu</a>, the <a href="MediaStatus.html">Media Status</a> window, or the <a href="SystemTab.html">System Tab</a> of Preferences. &nbsp;They are selected by choosing either the OSA or OSB machines with either the Axlon or Mosaic expansions.</blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">XL PBI Expansions</span></span><b><u></u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This area is used to choose the type of XL PBI expansion to
be used with XL series comuters. &nbsp;This choice may also be made
from the <a href="ControlMenu.html">Control Menu</a>. &nbsp;There are
three choices, either no expansion, or a MIO or Black Box Hard Drive
system. &nbsp; &nbsp;For either expansion system, a ROM file is
required, and not included with the emulator. (These may be found in
various locations on the internet). &nbsp;The ROM files may be selected
using the buttons on the lower part of this tab.<br><br>In addition,
hard disk files are required for the expansions. &nbsp;The hard disk
file may be created from the MacOSX Terminal with a command like the
following:<br><br>dd bs=256 count=xx if=/dev/null of=file.disk &nbsp;<br><br>Where
the 256 is the block size of the disk, xx is the number of 256 byte
blocks, and file.disk is the name of the hard disk file. &nbsp;Once the
file is chosen, it may be selected using the buttons on the lower part
of this tab.<br><br>For the Black Box expansion, to access the menu, use the Cmd-\ key combination.<br>

<b><u>NetSIO Expansion</u></b><br><br>
<blockquote>NetSIO is a protocol created by FujiNet developer apc that acts as a
    middle-man or bridge between the emulator and FujiNet-PC. Since FujiNet
    began as a real hardware device for Atari, it conforms to the SIO
    specifications and makes use of all the hardware pins on the SIO port
    and these pins must also be emulated for FujiNet to work correctly.
    NetSIO forms data packets that are passed to FujiNet-PC via UDP.
    The UDP Port used is specified here.<br><br>
    
    Info about FujiNet-PC can be found here:
    <a href="https://github.com/a8jan/fujinet-pc">https://github.com/a8jan/fujinet-pcs</a>
    <br><br>
    
    After you enable NetSIO here, you should start FujiNet-PC.  Atari800MacX
    will automatically connect to FujiNet-PC and boot the usual CONFIG
    program of Fujinet.<br><br>
    
    You may also enable/disable NetSIO from the Control Menu.

<br><br><b><u>Ultimate1mb Expansion</u></b><br><br>
This area is used to choose the file which contains
the Flash ROM image for the Ultimate1mb.  It should

This area is used to choose several options.<br>
First, you can choose the file which contains
the Flash ROM image for the SIDE2.  It should
be a 512mb Raw ROM image.
Second, you can choose the file which contains the
image for the Compact Flash disk attached to the
SIDE2.  It should either be a Raw image, or a VHD
type image.
Next, you can chose the state of the slide switch

Finally, you can choose the type of Flash that is
emulated inside of the Ultimate1mb and SIDE2
