The Media menu on the Atari800MacX emulator allows you to insert and
remove digital media into the emulator, the same way you would on a
real Atari. &nbsp;It
has the following menu selections:<br>






<br>






<b><u>Drive Management (cmd-D)</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item supplies access to a full Disk Drive
Management window which allows you to insert and remove disks in all 8
disk drives, as
well as manage the status of the emulated drives. &nbsp;Details on it's
operation
can be found <a href="DriveManagement.html">here</a>. <br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Insert Floppy (cmd-1 through cmd-8)</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This sub-menu allows you to insert an image file into any
of the
8 emulated disk drives. &nbsp;A .atr, .dcm, or .xfd file may also be
loaded
into the emulator by double-clicking it in the finder, or dragging it
to
the Atari800MacX Icon.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Remove Floppy (ctrl-cmd-1 through ctrl-cmd-8, and ctrl-cmd-0)</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This sub-menu allows you to remove a image file from one of
the emulated disk drives, or you may empty all of the drives at once.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Rotate Floppies<br>






</u></b>
<blockquote>This menu item rotates the current inserted floppies among
the drives.&nbsp; This may be useful for playing multiple disk games.<br>



</blockquote>



<u><b>New Floppy Image<br>





</b></u>
<blockquote>This item will display a new window which you may use to
create a new disk image. &nbsp;This new image will be saved in .atr
format.<br>





  <br>





In the Create Disk Image window,&nbsp; you may choose a format of a
disk. Note that not all formats are supported by all Atari DOSes. There
are three standard formats:<br>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Single density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 128 bytes/sector
= 90 KB)</li>



    <li>Medium density (40 tracks * 26 sectors/track * 128 bytes/sector
= 130 KB)</li>



    <li>Double density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 256 bytes/sector
= 180 KB)</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>





You can also select any other format, by clicking Custom and setting
Number of sectors and Bytes per sector. Please make sure your Atari DOS
supports this format, otherwise the image will be unusable.<br>





  <br>





If 256 bytes per sector are selected, you can choose between 128 and
256 Bytes in boot sectors. Physically, boot sectors (first three
sectors on
a disk) are also 256 bytes long, but only 128 are transmitted between
the
Atari and a disk drive (upper halves of sectors are not used). There
are
disk images with 128 bytes in boot sectors and disk images with 256
bytes
in boot sectors. The Atari800 emulator supports both, but other
emulators
don't. Except some special cases, we recommend 128 for ATR images.<br>





  <br>





If the "Insert New Disk image into drive" checkbox is checked, the
created image will be mounted on the specified drive.<br>

<u><b>New Cassette&nbsp;Image<br>





</b></u>
<blockquote>This item will create a new cassette file in the .cas
format. &nbsp;You will be prompted for the name of the new file, and
then it will be created and inserted into the cassette player.<br>



</blockquote>



<b><u>Edit an .atr Disk Image<br>






</u></b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to edit a Atari floppy disk image
in the .atr format.&nbsp; For more details on the editor, see the help
page on the <a href="DiskEditor.html">Disk Editor</a>.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Sector Edit an .atr Disk Image<br>






</u></b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to edit a Atari floppy disk image
in the .atr format.&nbsp; For more details on the editor, see the help
page on the <a href="SectorEditor.html">Sector Editor</a>.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Disk Image Conversions Submenu<br>






</u></b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to convert between the various
types of Atari disk image formats.&nbsp; You may convert .atr images to
.xfd, .dcm, or .scp types.&nbsp; You may also convert .xfd, .dcm, and
.scp images to .atr.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Insert Cartridge (cmd-C) </u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to insert a cartridge into the
emulator. &nbsp;If it is a raw ROM dump of the cartridge, you will need
to select the cartridge type from the displayed dialogue. &nbsp;If it
is a .car file, then this step will not be necessary. &nbsp;A .car,
.rom, or .bin file may also
be loaded into the emulator by double-clicking it in the finder, or
dragging
it to the Atari800MacX Icon.<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>Insert Basic Cartridge (cmd-B) </u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to insert a BASIC cartridge into the
emulator, using the BASIC ROM image that was selected on the ROMS tab
of the Prefrences.  Note, this option is only avaialble if you are
running a 400/800 type machine, a XL/XE has BASIC built in.<br>
</blockquote>


<b><u>Remove Cartridge (shift-cmd-C)</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to remove an inserted cartridge
from the emulator.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Insert SDX Piggyback Cartridge </u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to insert a second cartridge into the
emulator, if the first cartridge is a SpartaDosX cartridge. &nbsp;If it is a raw ROM dump of the cartridge, you will need
to select the cartridge type from the displayed dialogue. &nbsp;If it
is a .car file, then this step will not be necessary.&nbsp;<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Remove SDX Piggyback Cartridge </u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to remove an&nbsp;inserted piggyback cartridge
from the emulator.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Create .car From ROM File</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to convert a .car Cartridge file
into
a raw ROM dump, removing the cartridge type information.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Create ROM File from .car</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to convert a raw ROM dump of a
cartridge
into a .car format file, which contains the cartridge type information,
which
will allow you to not have to specify this when you insert the
cartridge.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Insert Cassette</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu items allows &nbsp;you to insert a cassette image
file
(.cas) into the emulator. The emulator
supports reading and writing from/to
cassette
images. &nbsp;A .cas file may also be loaded into the emulator by
double-clicking
it in the finder, or dragging it to the Atari800MacX Icon. &nbsp;Once
the cassette is started by holding start during reboot, or by using the
CLOAD/CSAVE basic call, you must press the space bar to continue
loading/saving the file.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Remove Cassette</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to remove an inserted cassette
from the emulator.</blockquote>






<b><u>Rewind Cassette</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to rewind the cassette inserted
into
the emulator, moving the current read pointer back to the first block.<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>Cassette Record</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to record new files on the cassette,
    much like pressing the record button on the actual cassette drive.
<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>Cassette Write Protect</u><br>
</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to write protect the cassette
    image to prevent it from being overwritten.<br>
</blockquote>

<b><u>Load Executable File</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item allows you to directly load an Atari
executable
file into the emulator, with using a DOS file system. &nbsp;This
executable
binary will exist as a file in the Macintosh environment, not on a disk
image.
&nbsp;A .XEX file may also be loaded into the emulator by
double-clicking
it in the finder, or dragging it to the Atari800MacX Icon.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Select Printer</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This sub-menu item allows you to&nbsp;allows you to chose
which printer emulation you are using. &nbsp;You may choose the Text
Printer, Atari 825, Atari 1020, or Epson FX-80.
&nbsp;The sub-menu also has an option to reset the printer, which is
equivalent
to turning the printer off and on. &nbsp;For more info on Printer
Emulation, see the <a href="PrinterEmulation.html">Printer Emulation</a> help page. &nbsp;For setting the printer options, see the <a href="PrinterTab.html">Printer Tab</a> in Preferences.<br>






</blockquote>






<b><u>Preview Printer Output</u><br>






</b>
<blockquote>This menu item&nbsp;is used to view
what the current printer output looks like. &nbsp;It is active for every
printer emulation except the Text Printer. 
</blockquote>






<b><u>Show Media Status Window</u><br>
