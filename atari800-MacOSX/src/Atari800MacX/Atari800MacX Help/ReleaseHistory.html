  </ul>



























  <li>Added builtin Disk Image Editor.&nbsp; This editor allows you to
edit ATR disk image files on a file level, importing/exporting
files&nbsp; to/from the Mac filesystem, as well as
deleting/renaming/locking/unlocking files, and
creating/renaming/deleting directories on Atari DOS's which support
them.&nbsp; Also, you can drag n' drop files to/from the disk images
and the Mac Finder.&nbsp; Supported Atari DOS types are Atari DOS 1.0,

intensive, and may slow down the frame rate the emulator is capable of.</li>



























  <li>Added the ability to display the frame rate while in Full Screen
in the lower left corner of the screen.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Added Console Sound (Keyclick) and Serio Sound (Disk read/write)

Version 1.6.0 Release 10-20-2003<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The major change in this version was
bringing the Atari800MacX source base up to the current release of the
base Atari800 Emulator.&nbsp;&nbsp; This resulted in the following
features:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>New Hi-Fi quality Sound Emulation.&nbsp; The old sound engine may
still be used by unchecking the "Use Hi-Fi Sound" option on the System
Panel of the Preferences Pane.&nbsp; Note the new sound engine does not
yet implement the key click or input/output sounds.&nbsp; If you wish
to have these sounds, the old sound engine must be selected.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Updated Cycle-exact graphics emulation. Improved handling of
DMACTL changes in the middle of a scanline
("Decathlon", "Mail Order Monsters"). Emulation of a DMACTL width
change bug.</li>



























  <li>Added Multijoy 4 Emulation - Allows the use of 4 joysticks on
XL/XE machines with custom software.</li>



























  <li>Added new cartridge type: Switchable XEGS 1 MB.</li>



























  <li>Added Rotate Disk command to Media menu and Disk Management
Dialog.</li>



























  <li>Added XF551 HighSpeed transfer Emulation.</li>



























  <li>Source code is now back in sync with Atari800 emulator.&nbsp;
(http://atari800.sourceforge.net)<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Fixed Atari 5200 crash after pressing SHIFT and * in "Super
Pacman".</li>



























  <li>Fixed crashing of emulator if disk or cartridge file specified in
a Saved State file could not be found.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























Version 1.5.0 Release 08-24-2003<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Added the ability to use a command key shortcut (Command-,) to
display the Preferences panel.</li>



























  <li>Added the ability to ignore the Header Write Protect Bit in ATR
images.&nbsp; If this bit is set, the emulator is unable to write to
the disk image.&nbsp; This prevented some demos and games from working,
since the user had no way to set the disk image to read/write.&nbsp;
(This
feature was added under the Atari System Pane of the Preferences.)<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Fixed emulator sound mixing.&nbsp; This allows the emulator to be
used with iTunes, etc., and not cause distortion of the music audio.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























Version 1.4.0 Release 05-08-2003<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Changed the way gamepad button assignment is handled, so that
different assignments can be given to different gamepads. &nbsp;This
allows users who have different types of gamepads to use them, and
assign the buttons differently. &nbsp;This change requires that any
changes to the gamepad assignments be saved to a named configuration
before the Preferences window is closed, or the changes will be lost.
&nbsp;Then the named configuration must be selected for the gamepads on
which it is to be used.</li>



























  <li>Added the ability to use gamepad buttons as joystick directions,
for gamepads which do not report hats, such as the iShock. &nbsp;Note,
this change can cause an incompatability in the Preferences file with
older versions of
the program. &nbsp;If you use this new version, and wish to go back to
an
older version, make sure and set gamepad assignments to other than
joystick directions, and joystick types to other than gamepad buttons
before using the older version, or the Preferences file will cause a
crash when the Preferences panel is opened.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Increased the maximum number of gamepad buttons to 24 from 16, to
handle devices such as the iShock.</li>



























  <li>Added the ability to specify which joystick or hat to use for the
controller
on gamepads which have multiple sticks or hats.</li>



























  <li>Cleaned up the Gamepad preferences panel, disabling menu items
when
they are not applicable.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Fixed state file saving/loading with cartridges larger than 8k.
&nbsp;WARNING: To implement this required a state file format change,
so state files saved with earlier versions will not load into 1.4.0.</li>



























  <li>Fixed gamepad button assignment, such that a button assigned to
shift or control can be used in conjunction with another button
assigned to a character. &nbsp;Note, that this will give the shifted
equivelent on the Atari keyboard, not the Mac keyboard (i.e. Shift-8
will be ^, not *).</li>



























  <li>Fixed issue which was preventing Rtime8 time emulation from
working. &nbsp;(Bug is present in 1.2.0 and later).</li>



























  <li>Fixed SDL bug which was causing Digital Hats to not work properly
on
gamepads (Up direction was flaky).</li>



























  <li>Fixed bug introduced in 1.3.0, causing Mouse based emulation to
not
work.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Fixed missing Atari key. &nbsp;Now able to type '|' character.</li>



























</ul>



























Version 1.3.0 Release 03-13-2003<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Added ANTIC/GTIA Cycle Exact code from Atari800 core emulator.
&nbsp;This adds compatability with several games and demos. &nbsp;See
Compatability page of program help for more detail.</li>



























  <li>Added ability to save and load multiple Disk Sets from the Disk
Management window. &nbsp;(Also from the Fullscreen UI). &nbsp;See the
Media page of the program help for details.</li>



























  <li>Ability to handle 4 USB Gamepads. &nbsp;This change will require
users of earlier versions to respecify their joystick emulations.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Added x3 Scaling and x4 Scaling on Windowed Display, and added
the ability to lock Fullscreen display to 640x480 (on by default)</li>



























  <li>Added Cartridge and Disk state information to State files.
&nbsp;Now when loading a saved state, the cartridge and disks present
when the state was saved will be mounted. &nbsp;The state file format
has not changed, but the disk/cartridge info was added to the end.<br>



























  </li>



























  <li>Added Backquote (`) as break key, in addition to Pause/F15.</li>



























  <li>Added Known Bugs page to Help pages.</li>



























  <li>Added Hot Key (F7) for "Limit to Normal Speed"</li>



























  <li>Added Emulator message window, which is used to display debug and
informational messages from the Emulator core. &nbsp;It can be found
under
the Control menu.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Fixed Break key/Interrupt bug from Atari800 core emulator</li>



























  <li>Fixed bug where Gamepad Joystick would stick in one or two
directions, unless moved in the other direction. &nbsp;This bug would
go away after
a few mintues, but was very annoying :). (But amazing easy to fix...."I
love it when a plan comes together" :)).</li>



























  <li>Fixed bug with Boot Disk Images where only one or two images
could be specified without crashing the program.</li>



























  <li>Fixed bug where Atari Inverse, Clr-Tab, Set-Tab, Insert-Char,
Insert-Line, Delete-Char, and Delete-Line keys were not recognized by
the emulator.</li>



























  <li>Moved Mouse Grab key(F12 to F11), as it conflicted with Optical
Media Eject on non-Apple keyboards.</li>



























  <li>Fixed BW/Color conversion bug in Pallette Formating code from
core emulator.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























Version 1.2.0 Release 01-14-2003<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Added ability to program keys used for keyboard emulation of
joysticks.</li>



























  <li>Completed subdirectory support for DOS functions for the hard
drives. &nbsp;This support works best with Spartdos and BWDos, as it
works with the command line in them, but will be supported by XIO
functions with any DOS.</li>



























  <li>Added support for AlphaOmega Software's Extended Software
Updater, to allow user to find out about new versions of program.</li>



























  <li>Fixed Folder Icons in Application Folder (Thanks Matt :) ).<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Fixed issues with special key assignments on gamepads (Select,
Option, Reset, Shift, Ctrl).</li>



























  <li>Fixed issue with "Boot From Casette" preference change not
taking after Prefs panel closed.</li>



























  <li>Fixed issue where if Boot Disk was not found, application would
quit.</li>



























</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Added full Gamepad control, alowing gamepad buttons to be
assigned to Atari buttons/keypress, and selection of joysticks on
gamepads with both Analog and Digital stcks.</li>



























  <li>Added the capability to use the X-axis of an analog joystick or
mouse for both paddles of a paddle set.</li>



























  <li>Added 13 Cartridge types from Atari800 Emulator Core.</li>



























  <li>Atari800MacX now supports all normal DOS functions for the hard
drives, including Rename, Delete, Note, Point, and Open for modify
(read/write). Subdirectories are not supported at this time, but may
be in a future release.</li>



























  <li>Changed command key shortcuts to follow Macintosh standards.</li>



























  <li>5200 Emulator without a cartridge now displays a screen
indicating user should insert a cartrdige, instead of a blank screen.<br>



























  </li>



























</ul>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>5200 Emulator crashing after cartridge is removed.</li>



























  <li>Machine type switching bugs when cartridge is changed.</li>



























  <li>Bug fixes in libSDL graphics libarary.</li>

features and bug fixes:<br>



























<br>



























&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>



























<ul>



























  <li>Full Stereo sound capability added (actually fixed), as
well as several sound bug fixes. &nbsp;Sound is greatly improved.</li>



























  <li>Emulation of printing thru Atari P: device fully supported, which
allows printing to a text file opened by a program of your choice.</li>



























  <li>Ported the Atari800 R: device drivers to allow you to "dial-in"
to BBS software through telnet and a user specified port number.
&nbsp;Many thanks to Daniel Noguerol for his hard work on the original
and ported versions of the driver.</li>



























  <li>Ability to load color palettes from external files, or generate
your own custom palettes. As a black and white palette is one of the
included files, ability to change to Black and White has been removed
from the program.</li>



























  <li>Monitor panel added. &nbsp;This allows the user to display
emulated memory, registers, display lists, etc.</li>



























  <li>Full 5200 Controller support added, including 2nd button and
keypad. &nbsp;See Help Keyboard page for details.</li>



























  <li>Mac analog joysticks now provide paddle input as well (for Super
Breakout, etc.). &nbsp;They also provide true analog input for 5200
joysticks.</li>



























  <li>5200 emulation is now pasued until you insert a cartridge, since
the real 5200 did not run without a cartridge. &nbsp;Also, it was
causing an anoying crash cycle without the cartridge.<br>
